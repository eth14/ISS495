# ISS495

This houses the files for the ISS Capstone Project Spring 2022 website. 

index.html will be the home page and the only page that is unique in design from the others.

debunking.html will be the first of the five topic sites we will create and once we have a design we like for that site (but before we fill with content) 
we should be able to copy and paste to create templates for the other topic sites.

main.css will be the primary styling sheet for the website as a whole. Much of the code for main.css was pulled from some W3 Schools site that I need to go find 
so I can credit, and can create pages that look like < https://people.duke.edu/~eth14/labs/LAB_12.html > if desired.
